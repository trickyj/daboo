<h2>Contemporty Art conference 2017</h2>
<p>

Join over 500 hundred of the most creative and brilliant minds of art colleges all around the world for five days of lectures by world-renowned art scholars and artists, and seven days and nights of gallery exhibits featuring the best in contemporary art, including painting, sculpture, and more, in the beautiful halls of Hotel Contempo in the heart of Seattle.</p>

<p class="hidden-sm"> The Roux Academy's annual conference and exhibit is designed to foster a close-knit relationship amongst artists at various universities around the world. No matter what school you attend - if you're an art student at an accredited art school anywhere in the world, you can attend the conference. But sign up early, as this not-to-miss conference sells out quickly, and the waiting list is long. In addition, art students are encouraged to send in works from their school portfolios to be considered for hanging in the CAC exhibit halls, as well as to be selected as a Featured Artist.</p>
